== Description ==

**Validate Profile Credentials and Names**

In a WordPress site users have multiple names in their profile, the user login, display name and nick name. In a multi-user site, there is often a need to keep them unique. You need to allow users have only credible names, such that,

* All display names are unique
* All nicknames are unique
* No nickname is a display name or login name of another user
* No display name is a nickname or login name of another user

Credible Names is a easy plugin to help you with that.

== Installation ==
